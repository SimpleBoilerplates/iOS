# Boilerplates

This is a very simple Boilerplate application, this has following features.

  - User can Sign In and Up
  - After signing in he can see a list of items
  
  * I didn't add many functionality and didn't polish UI intentionally, tried to keep it barebone as much as possible 
  
  ### Same implementation in other platforms
   - [Android](https://github.com/simpleboilerplates/BooksDemoAndroid) 
   - [React Native](https://github.com/SimpleBoilerplates/React-Native) 
   - [NodeJS backend](https://github.com/simpleboilerplates/BooksDemoNode) 

 
# With

  - MVVM architecture
  - [Moya](https://github.com/Moya/Moya) for API call
  - Avoiding string identifier to instantiate a view controller from storyboard
  - Project by feature not by layer
