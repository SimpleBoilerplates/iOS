# Boilerplates

This is a very simple Boilerplate application, this has following features.

  - User can Sign In and Up
  - After signing in he can see a list of items
  
  * I didn't add many functionality and didn't polish UI intentionally, tried to keep it barebone as much as possible 
  
  ### Same implementation in other platforms
